  <h1>Theory Behind the Simulation</h1>
  <p>
    This simulation demonstrates gravitational lensing around a black hole using approximations inspired by general relativity.
    The black hole is modeled with an <strong>event horizon</strong> defined by the Schwarzschild radius <em>R<sub>s</sub> = 2M</em> (in geometric units where G = c = 1).
    The <strong>photon sphere</strong>, located roughly at 3M, is the region where light can orbit the black hole.
  </p>
  <p>
    The simulation applies a <strong>thin-lens approximation</strong> to model light deflection. For an incoming ray at an angular distance <em>θ</em> from the black hole’s center,
    the deflected ray is computed using a formula akin to:
    <br><br>
    <em>β = θ - (θ<sub>E</sub><sup>2</sup> / θ)</em>,
    <br><br>
    where <em>θ<sub>E</sub></em> (the Einstein radius) is proportional to the mass of the black hole. This approximation is tuned for visual plausibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, a <strong>spin parameter</strong> (a dimensionless quantity) is included to simulate frame dragging, resulting in a spiral distortion
    of the lensed image. All parameters are expressed in geometric units:
    <br>
    – Mass (M) is in geometric mass units,
    <br>
    – Distance (r) is measured in the same units,
    <br>
    – Spin (a) is dimensionless.
